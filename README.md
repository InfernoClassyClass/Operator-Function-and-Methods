# Homework Practice Submission

## This is where you will store all your homework practice.

1. You are required to commit and push your changes to your repository at the end of every class with the practice solutions **even if you have not completed it**
2. Organize your solutions into folders pertraining the practice sheet and files named correctly with respects to the question involved.
3. This folder will be used to assess your progress in your course. Not all the items will be marked, but some will be randomly chosen to.

If working on the problems using repl with GitHub intergration, make sure to set your .replit file to run the practice file you want. For example, here's a file called question 1 that will run from the operator practice folder in python practice:

```
language="python3"
run="python 'Python Practice/Operator Practice/Question 1.py'"
```
